# Kitty-Terminal Configuration

This is my Kitty configuration. Head over to [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/#) to check it out.
I added a theme and FiraCode Font with ligatures, to get some better looks.

# Installation

Head to `~/.config/` and clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mac10goesBRRRT/kitty
```
You might need to install the Font for this, which can be found [here](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
